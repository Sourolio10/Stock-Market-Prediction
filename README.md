# Stock-Market-Prediction
This program is predicting the stock price of Amazon Stock Data. By this program, we can conclude that Linear Regression package of Machine Learning in Python can be used effectively to predict the stock market prices of different stock data-sets. Linear Regression is a machine learning algorithm based on supervised learning. It performs a regression task. Regression models a target prediction value based on independent variables. It is mostly used for finding out the relationship between variables and forecasting. Different regression models differ based on â€“ the kind of relationship between dependent and independent variables, they are considering and the number of independent variables being used.


Multiple steps that the model has to go through before it is available for use:

Step 1: Making the model examine data.

Step 2: Making the model learn from its mistakes.

Step 3: Making a conclusion on how well the model performs.

And the ouput gives 76% accuracy using MultiLinear Reggresor.
